Deploy driver program on Windows based virtual machines 
=======================================================

We will use the Windows based VM, more specifically the Windows 7 VMs.
Windows 8.1 is, however, more future proof as it has longer support.
Right now, we do not recommend using Windows 10 because of its forced updates that cannot be 
completely deactivated.

1 Create virtual machines
-------------------------

These steps describe how to setup Windows 7 VM in VirtualBox, but they are practically identical
also for newer systems with some parts of the OS having slightly different names. 

### 1.1 Set up virtual machine

For production purposes it is recommended to create a VM from scratch.
For development or testing, however, one can also download a pre-installed VM directly from 
[Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) with 90 day evaluation 
license. 

* Install some recent version of VirtualBox.

* If you want to create a new VM from scratch:

    * Create a new VM.

    * Type some name, e.g. **VC-Windows**.

    * Make sure to create a virtual hard drive when asked to (should be the default option). 

    * In the *Memory size* dialog, type at least 4096 MB if you want to use all supported AVs. 

    * In the following dialogs, just leave the recommended options.

###### Note: Windows needs 1 GB of RAM just for itself. For each running antivirus you should allocate additional 512 MB of RAM at least. 

The virtual machine is now created, however, we need to specify a few additional options like 
networking or location of the installation media.

* Now in the *Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager* right click on the newly created/imported VM and select 
*Settings*.

* Navigate to the *System* tab.
    * Select the *Processor* sub-tab.
    * Make sure the VM has allocated at least 4 processors.
     More is usually better but do not go beyond "green" part of the slider.

* Navigate to the *Storage* tab. 
    * In the *Storage Devices* pane click on the CD icon labeled as *Empty*. 
    * In the right-hand side *Attributes* pane click on the similar looking CD icon located to the 
    right of the *Optical Drive* label and select the *Choose the Virtual Optical Disk file* 
    option.  
    * Open your Windows iso file and close the *Settings* window by clicking on the *OK* button.
          
* Navigate to the *Network* tab.
    * Make sure the *Enable Network Adapter* is checked.
    * Expand the *Advanced* options and press the *Port Forwarding* button.
    * Click on the green `+` icon at the top right corner of the newly opened window.
    * A port forwarding rule should be created. Now we need to configure it.
        * Double click on **Rule 1** under the *Name* tab and and rename it, perhaps, to 
        **Driver rule**.
        * Analogously change the **0** under the *Host Port* to **8081**.
        * Finally change the **0** under the *Guest Port* to **8080** and press *OK*.
        
### 1.2 Install Windows on the virtual machine

###### Skip this subsection if using a pre-installed VM.
 
* Start the newly created VM and install the operating system.

* Disable all Windows updates. On Windows 7, this can be done just before the end of the 
installation process.

* Install the *Guest Additions*. 
    * At the top of the running virtual machine window, click on the *Devices* menu and press the 
    *Insert Guest Additions CD Image*.
    * Open the virtual CD Drive, available in *Computer*/*This PC* as a *D:* drive
    * Run the *VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe* and follow the installation steps.
    * After restarting the virtual machine, click on *Devices* top menu item and set *Shared 
    Clipboard* and *Drag and Drop* settings to *Host To Guest*. 
    
* (Optional) For the sake of saving some VM resources, it may be helpful to use the Windows 
Classic or Basic theme. 


### 1.3 Install Java

The driver application requires JRE 1.8 or newer.
The free and open source Java distributions like AdoptOpenJDK are fully sufficient.

### 1.4 (Optional) Take a snapshot

Now the virtual machine should be prepared to install the supported AVs.

In the virtual machine topside panel select *Machine* and press *Take snapshot*. 
This will create a backup of the virtual machine in the exactly same state as it is now.

2 Install and configure antivirus
---------------------------------

Driver program currently supports the aforementioned AVs on Windows: Avast, Eset, Kaspersky, 
Microsoft (Security Essentials or Defender).

### 2.1 Avast (paid)

You need the *Avast Pro Antivirus* or *Avast Internet Security*.

This guide assumes the installation of Avast Internet Security, however the other case is basically 
identical.

Optional: After launching the installer, click on the *Customize* button and disable all components 
except the *File Shield*.

#### 2.1.1 Configuration

Open the Avast window and click on the *Protection* tab at the left side of the window.
Then click on the, barely visible, cogwheel setup icon at the right side of the window.

In the *Settings* window disable the following features:

* In the *General* -> *Update* navigate to the *Your application is up to date*, click on 
*More options* and select the *Manual update* option. This will disable the automatic application 
updates and keep only virus definitions to be updated.   

* In the *Protection* tab permanently disable the *Core shields*, *Ransomware Shield*, 
*Firewall* and *Real site* features if they were. 

* In the *Privacy* tab, disable the *Sensitive Data Shield*.

* In the *Detection engine* -> *HIPS* tab, make sure the *Enable HIPS* option is disabled. 

* In the *Licensing* window click on the green symbol `x` located to the right of 
*License key* label.

* In the *Firewall* tab, uncheck the *Enable Firewall* option.  

* In the *Web and email* tab, uncheck the *Enable application protocol content filtering* option.  

#### 2.1.2 Command line utility

Avast provides the command line utility called *ashCmd.exe* that may be used to scan the 
selected file for malware and to store human readable reports to specified file.

By default, our driver application assumes that the *ashCmd.exe* program is available in the *Path* 
system variable. To do this, follow these steps:

* Press *Start*, search "Computer" (on Win 7) or "This PC" (on Win 10), right click on the found 
program with the same name and select *Properties* 

* On the left-hand side open the *Advanced system settings*.

* Press the *Environment Variables* button.

* Locate the *Path* variable in the bottom white field labeled as *System variables* and press 
the *Edit...* button below.

* Add the installation path of the Avast to the beginning of *Variable value* text. 
In my case the path is `C:\Program Files\AVAST Software\Avast`.
  
    If you also installed the AdoptOpenJDK 8, the *Variable value* should now look like this. 
    
    ```C:\Program Files\AVAST Software\Avast;C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.04-hotspot\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\```
    
### 2.2 Eset (paid)

Install any of the Eset antivirus software, i.e. *Eset Nod32*, *Eset Internet Security*, ... .
This guide assumes the installation of Eset Internet Security, however, in the case of other Eset
 products the steps are basically identical.

#### 2.2.1 Configuration

Open the Eset window and click on the setup icon at the left side of the window. 
Disable all features in the *Computer protection*, *Internet protection*, *Network protection* 
and *Security protection* options.

Click on the *Advanced setup* icon at the bottom side of the window, or just press *F5* key.

* In the *Detection engine* -> *Real-time file system protection* tab, uncheck the *Enable 
Real-time file system protection*. 

* In the *Detection engine* -> *Cloud-based protection* tab, uncheck the *Enable ESET 
LiveGrid@ reputation system* and *Enable ESET LiveGrid@ feedback system* options.

* In the *Detection engine* -> *HIPS* tab, make sure the *Enable HIPS* option is disabled. 

* In the *Licensing* window click on the green symbol `x` located to the right of 
*License key* label.

* In the *Firewall* tab, uncheck the *Enable Firewall* option.  

* In the *Web and email* tab, uncheck the *Enable application protocol content filtering* option.  

#### 2.2.2 Command line utility

Eset provides the command line utility called *ecls.exe* that may be used to scan the 
selected file for malware and to store human readable reports to specified file.

By default, our driver application assumes that the *ecls.exe* program is available in the *Path* 
system variable. To do this, follow these steps:

* Press *Start*, search "Computer" (on Win 7) or "This PC" (on Win 10), right click on the found 
program with the same name and select *Properties* 

* On the left-hand side open the *Advanced system settings*.

* Press the *Environment Variables* button.

* Locate the *Path* variable in the bottom white field labeled as *System variables* and press 
the *Edit...* button below.

* Add the installation path of the Eset to the beginning of *Variable value* text. 
In my case the path is `C:\Program Files\ESET\ESET Security`.
  
    If you also installed the AdoptOpenJDK 8, the *Variable value* should now look like this. 
    
    ```C:\Program Files\ESET\ESET Security;C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.04-hotspot\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\```
    
### 2.3 Kaspersky (free)

Install the Kaspersky Free Antivirus, now called the *Kaspersky Security Cloud*. 
You may also use the paid version, but for our purposes the paid version does not bring any 
benefits.

#### 2.3.1 Configuration

Open the Kaspersky window and click on the settings icon at the bottom of the window. The list of 
features to disable includes:

* In the *General* tab, disable the *Perform recommended actions automatically*

* In the *Protection* tab, disable all options. In the free version the options in this tab are 
  not editable. The workaround around this comprises the following:
    * Press the big red button labeled as *Upgrade protection* 
    and select trial license. 
    * Disable all options in the *Protection* tab.
    * On the bottom of the window click on the green *License* text label. 
    * In the *Licensing* window click on the green symbol `x` located to the right of 
    *License key* label.
    * Then select *Back to Kaspersky Free* option.  
* In the *Additional* tab, do the following:
    * In the *Update* options, check *Do not download new versions...*
    * In the *Reports and Quarantine settings* uncheck the *Store reports no longer than* 
        checkbox.

#### 2.3.2 Command line utility

Kaspersky provides the command line utility called *avp.com* that may be used to scan the 
selected file or directory for malware and to store human readable reports to specified file.
It can also update the virus database.

By default, our driver application assumes that the *avp.com* program is available in the *Path* 
system variable. To do this, follow these steps:

* Press *Start*, search "Computer" (on Win 7) or "This PC" (on Win 10), right click on the found 
program with the same name and select *Properties* 

* On the left-hand side open the *Advanced system settings*.

* Press the *Environment Variables* button.

* Locate the *Path* variable in the bottom white field labeled as *System variables* and press 
the *Edit...* button below.

* Add the installation path of the Eset to the beginning of *Variable value* text. 
  Example path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Security Cloud 20.0`
    
    If you also installed the AdoptOpenJDK 8, the *Variable value* should now look like this. 
    
    ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Security Cloud 20.0;C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.04-hotspot\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\```
    
### 2.4 Windows Defender/Microsoft Security Essentials (free)

Windows 8, 8,1 and 10 contains a quite capable antivirus called Windows Defender.

If you have already installed the other antivirus software, the defender will be disabled.
On Windows 10 you can o turn it on again by clicking on *Start* -> *Settings* -> *Update & Security*
 -> *Turn on Windows Defender*. 

If you have a Windows 7 VM then you need to install Microsoft Security Essentials as Windows 
Defender on this system is unusable for our purposes.

#### 2.4.1 Configuration

##### A) Microsoft Security Essentials (Windows 7)

Open the antivirus window and click on the *Settings* tab at the left side of the window.

Disable the following features:

* In the *Scheduled scan* tab, uncheck the *Run a scheduled scan on my PC*. 

* In the *Real-time protection* tab, uncheck the *Turn on real-time protection*.

* In the *MAPS* tab, make sure the *I don't want to join MAPS* option is selected. 

Microsoft Security Essentials tends to enable Windows Update if it has been disabled before.
If this is also your case, than disable Windows Update once again. 

##### B) Windows Defender (Windows 10)

Windows 8 version of defender has different UI, however the idea is similar - to disable all 
automatic protection features except virus database updates.
  
Run the *Windows Security* app from the *start* menu. 

###### If you have already installed another antivirus software, the Defender will be disabled by default. Just click on *Turn on Windows Defender* in Windows Security app. 

Disable the following features:

* In the *Virus & threat protection* tab, turn off the *Tamper protection*. 

* In the *App & browser control* tabs, select *Off* option for each setting. 

(TODO) Disable telemetry

#### 2.4.3 Command line utility

Microsoft provides the command line utility called *MpCmdRun.exe* that may be used to scan the 
selected file for malware.

By default, our driver application assumes that the *MpCmdRun.exe* program is available in the *Path* 
system variable. To do this, follow these steps:

* Press *Start*, search "Computer" (on Win 7) or "This PC" (on Win 10), right click on the found 
program with the same name and select *Properties* 

* On the left-hand side open the *Advanced system settings*.

* Press the *Environment Variables* button.

* Locate the *Path* variable in the bottom white field labeled as *System variables* and press 
the *Edit...* button below.

##### A) Microsoft Security Essentials (Windows 7)

* Add the installation path of the Microsoft Security Essentials to the beginning of 
*Variable value* text. 
In my case the path is `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client`.
  
    If you also installed the AdoptOpenJDK 8, the *Variable value* should now look like this. 
    
    ```C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client;C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.04-hotspot\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\```
    
* A reboot of the virtual machine is now recommended.

##### B) Windows Defender (Windows 10)

* Add the installation path of the Defender to the beginning of *Variable value* text. 
In my case the path is `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client`.
  
    If you also installed the AdoptOpenJDK 8, the *Variable value* should now look like this. 
    
    ```C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client;C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.04-hotspot\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\```
